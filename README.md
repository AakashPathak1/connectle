## 📖 Overview

Connectle is an engaging word chain game that challenges players to find a path between two seemingly unrelated words by making single-word steps. The unique twist: each consecutive pair of words must have at least 60% semantic similarity, as determined by advanced NLP algorithms. This creates a puzzle that tests both vocabulary and creative thinking.

Unlike traditional word association games that rely on direct relationships, Connectle leverages semantic similarity to create more nuanced connections between words, making for a deeper and more intellectually stimulating experience.

## ✨ Features

### Core Gameplay
- **Daily Word Pairs**: A new start and end word pair each day with definitions
- **Semantic Validation**: Words must have at least 60% semantic similarity to be accepted
- **Unlimited Attempts**: Players can try as many times as needed to solve the puzzle
- **Word Validation**: Real-time checking against an English dictionary
- **Chain Visualization**: Visual representation of the word chain as it's built
- **Backtracking**: Option to remove the last word and try a different path

### Player Assistance
- **NLP-Powered Hints**: Get suggestions when stuck based on semantic proximity
- **Word Definitions**: Access to definitions for better understanding of word meanings
- **Similarity Scores**: See exactly how similar your words are to guide your choices
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual indication of how close you are to the target word

### User Experience
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile play
- **Dark/Light Themes**: Toggle between visual modes for comfort
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions and feedback using Framer Motion
- **Error Handling**: Clear feedback when words don't meet criteria
- **Loading States**: Visual indicators during API calls

### Game Statistics
- **Best Chain Tracking**: Records your shortest successful path
- **Completion Time**: Tracks how long it takes to solve the puzzle
- **Hints Used**: Counts how many hints were requested
- **Share Results**: Option to share your success on social media
- **Daily Stats**: View your performance compared to other players

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Start**: You'll see the starting word and the target word, each with its definition
2. **Enter Words**: Type a word that is semantically similar to the current word (at least 60% similarity)
3. **Build Chain**: Continue adding words that are similar to your previous word
4. **Reach Target**: Keep building your chain until you reach the target word
5. **Optimize**: Try to find the shortest possible path between the words

### Example Chain

Starting word: **ocean** → **water** → **drink** → **food** → **meal** → Target word: **dinner**

Each consecutive pair of words has at least 60% semantic similarity, creating a valid path from "ocean" to "dinner".
